**•** Concurrent Collections – collections that work more efficiently in a multi-threaded environment than collections from the java.util package. Instead of the base wrapper - Collections.synchronizedList, blocking access to the entire collection uses blocking by data segments

**•** Queues – non-blocking and blocking queues with multithreading support. Non-blocking queues are sharpened for speed and operation without blocking threads. Blocking queues are used when it is necessary to “slow down” threads, if no conditions are met, for example, the queue is empty or overflowed

**•** Synchronizers – auxiliary utilities for synchronizing threads. Represent a powerful weapon in "parallel" calculations

**•** Executors – it contains excellent frameworks for creating thread pools, planning the work of asynchronous tasks with the result

**•** Locks – it is an alternative and more flexible thread synchronization mechanism compared to the synchronized(), wait() and notify() base methods

**•** Atomics – classes with support for atomic operations on primitives and references
